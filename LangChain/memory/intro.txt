ConversationBufferMemory ::
         Stores a transcript of recent messages. Great for short chats but can grow large quickly.

ConversationBufferWindowMemory::

Summarizer-Based Memory::
         Periodically summarizes older chat segments to keep a condensed memory footprint.

Custom Memory::
         For advanced use cases, you can store specialized state (e.g., the userâ€™s preferences or key facts about them) in a custom memory class.
