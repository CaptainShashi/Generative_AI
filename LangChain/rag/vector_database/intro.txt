## --> What are Vector Stores


A vector store is a system designed to store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors.

Key Features

1. Storage ::
       Ensures that vectors and their associated metadata are retained, whether in-memory for quick lookups or on-disk for durability and large-scale use.

2. Similarity Search ::
       Helps retrieve the vectors most similar to a query vector.

3. Indexing ::
       Provide a data structure or method that enables fast similarity searches on high-dimensional vectors (e.g., approximate nearest neighbor lookups).

4. CRUD Operations :: 
       Manage the lifecycle of dataâ€”adding new vectors, reading them, updating existing entries, removing outdated vectors.

Use-cases

1. Semantic Search  
2. RAG  
3. Recommender Systems  
4. Image/Multimedia search
