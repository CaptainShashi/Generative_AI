we can build a pipeline with chains with any llms

supppose we want to build a LLM that takes large input(1000words) in english , in output we nee dsummary in less than 100 words 

( input --> LLM --> translate --> LLM --> summery)

if you dont use a pipeline we have to manually do all the above steps 

@ chains can solve the problem by 
   automatically send the output from the mediate steps to the next LLM 
   we can direclty pass output of intermediate steps to the next step without manually writing code to it 

   1) parallel chains

            input -->LLM1 --> report -->combine --> output
              |              /
              |           /
              |        /
              |    /
             LLM2
    
    2) sequential chains

      topic ----> LLM ----> reports ----> LLM -----> summery

    3) conditional chains    ( similar to parallel chain )
